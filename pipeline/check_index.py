This runs in CI before the index is committed. Every check here corresponds to a
way the index can be silently wrong -- silently, because the UI would still load
and search would still return rows; they would just be the wrong rows, or point
at the wrong URLs. A column that is off by one is invisible until a user clicks a
result and lands on an unrelated post.

# Golden (HN item id -> title) pairs, verified against the live Algolia API.
# The index is four files that must agree row-for-row: titles.txt, paths.txt,
# posts.bin and hn.bin. Nothing inside the index can detect a permutation bug
# between them -- every file stays individually well-formed, every count still
# matches, and the UI happily renders a real title next to another post's HN
# thread and a third post's URL. These pairs are the outside reference.
# build_index.py now reorders every column by score, which is exactly the kind
# of change that breaks this silently.
