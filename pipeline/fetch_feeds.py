"""Discover and fetch RSS/Atom feeds for a list of blogs.

Why this exists alongside the HN data: HN only ever surfaces the posts that
happened to go viral. A blog's best writing frequently never hits the front
page. Feeds give us the blog's own view of what it published.

Caveat baked into expectations: most feeds are truncated to the latest 10-50
entries, so this yields freshness and depth-of-recent, not full archives.
